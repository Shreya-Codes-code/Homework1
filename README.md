The haar feature continuously traverses from the top left of the image to the bottom right to search for the particular feature. 
This is just a representation of the whole concept of the haar feature traversal. In its actual work, the haar feature would traverse pixel by pixel in the image. Also all possible sizes of the haar features will be applied.
Depending on the feature each one is looking for, these are broadly classified into three categories. The first set of two rectangle features are responsible for finding out the edges in a horizontal or in a vertical direction (as shown above). 
The second set of three rectangle features are responsible for finding out if there is a lighter region surrounded by darker regions on either side or vice-versa. 
The third set of four rectangle features are responsible for finding out change of pixel intensities across diagonals.
